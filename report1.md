CS480 - Report 1 Feasibility

The first matter to cover in terms of feasibility is making sure we are all on the same page as a group. We have decided to use Python as the primary language of our project. This is due to the fact that we all have a good understanding of what we are and are capable of in Python, along with it being a fairly simple language to begin working with immediately. For the sake of version control we will all be using version 3.10.1 for Python as well as the IDE Pycharm. These tools are subject to change; however, we believe at this time they will be the best tools to accomplish the job.

In terms of organization, our current plan is to keep a changelog similar to that of which professor Leitert showed in class. We don't have specifics as to who will be working on what yet, but that will be decided within the next few days as we begin to work. It may be best to assign one person to managing the changelog that way the notes will always be in the same style.

Looking at what information we may need to accomplish this, there are the obvious resources needed such as the class list, the list of students, their completed classes, and projected graduation date. With this information, we will be able to assign the most eligible students as TA's to the most possible classes, minimizing those that have to miss out on the quarter.

In regards to what we have already accomplished, everyone in our group has downloaded Python as well as the Pycharm IDE. We have also created a Git repository for the project and invited each member of our group to the repository. We have also created a Discord server in order to better communicate with each other concerning the project.
